Among numerous online plugins, there was **RBRnet** by **Racer_S**,
a launcher that allowed you to play with other people **in real time**.


This launcher only supports original tracks and is very outdated,
making it difficult to setup on modern systems.


Making an **RBRnet** like plugin will be an incentive to practice
network programming.

You can [watch the original RBRnet in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AatOLX0xRrA).
