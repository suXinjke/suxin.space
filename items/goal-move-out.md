Living in [Norilsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk) hinders my work, here's why:

* Slow and sometimes outright unstable internet
* Timezone issues
* The only way out is an expensive plane ticket
* Which makes moving around country expensive in general
* **Less opportunities because of that**
* Future of Norilsk is uncertain

On summer 2018 I had my first ever solo trip around my own country.
I quickly realised how much better the other places might be,
the parks and forests I've visited made me happy.

Right now I'm looking for another trip opportunity to decide where I should move to.
