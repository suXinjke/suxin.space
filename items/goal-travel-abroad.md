Travelling abroad seems like a natural outcome from travelling your own country.
Here's the countries I'd like to visit and why:

* **UK**: to visit Tower of London and it's ravens
* **USA**: to meet my favorite content creators
* **Finland**: to attend [WRC rally](https://www.nesterallyfinland.fi/en/)
* **Germany**: to experience [NÃ¼rburgring Nordschleife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring) atleast as a passenger
* **Japan**: to feel alien

These reasons may not seem grand, but that's what makes my approach:
**these are only to get me there.** I don't have any other
plans or expectations, and having no plan is exactly what I like
in travelling.
