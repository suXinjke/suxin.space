Initially made to moderate and ban for disgusting chat messages,
**Secretary bird** was then transfered to a certain **Discord community** I'm no
longer a part of.

Nowadays, this bird bot keeps answering the dumbest questions, can
announce **Twitch streams** and is also available to use **Twitter**.

By interacting with the bot we've found out that it's rather angry
and loves **pepsi** and **kit-kat** alot.

Nothing impressive, but always got the job done, [source code here](https://github.com/suXinjke/SecretaryBird).
