I find it ironic that despite playing lots of games, understanding how they may work
and being interested in reverse engineering - **I still never made a proper game on my own**.

**Half-Payne** doesn't really count, and that weird
obscure Tic-Tac-Toe for 4 players with network support, made long time ago doesn't count either.

I want to start small while trying out available tools/engines for making games,
so I could figure out my preferences. It'd be also great to take a part in **game jams** and
potentially gain exposure that could be used in larger projects with more experience.

**Game jams** are also a good idea because they have a **strict deadline**, preventing
potential waste of time.

**Unfortunately, current priorities are not in favor of making games.**
