Frustrated with not understanding how to improve times,
I remembered delta timing feature available in other simracing games: **Assetto Corsa** or **GT Sport**.

The **Delta Shakedown** plugin will store very small splits of time,
which could be compared by in later sessions. Because splits are very small,
it should be easy to determine how your driving style or car setup affects the resulting time.

It would also be great to load any replay and store it's delta data.

This project will be an incentive to try making a plugin for **Richard Burns Rally**
and practice reverse engineering to launch replay playback.
