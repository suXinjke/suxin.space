**Sasha / suXin**

I'm a Russian developer focused on getting things done rather than wasting my time.

Due to huge variety of finished projects, I stopped obsessing over tools and best
practices, instead making finished job and delivered product my first priority, while
also making sure it's easy to do and maintain later.

I always look for some value for myself or other people in every project approached,
be it solving a problem or a learning opportunity.

Occasionally, I help people with programming in [Discord](https://discord.gg/BQN6BYE).

Aside from programming and development, I'm also interested in video game design, travelling, racing and birds.
