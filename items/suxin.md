**Sasha / suXin**

I'm a Russian developer focused on getting things done rather than wasting my time.

With a wide variety of projects, I stopped obsessing over tools and best
practices. Now finishing the product is all that matters and I'd rather
make sure it's easy to do and maintain later.

I always look for some value for me and other people in every project approached,
be it solving a problem or a learning opportunity, and it better be done with utmost respect.

Occasionally, I help people with development in [Discord](https://discord.gg/BQN6BYE).

Aside from development, I'm also interested in video game design, travelling, racing and birds.
