**Sasha / suXin**

I'm generalist developer focused on getting things done. I'm currently most experienced at frontend web development and writing JavaScript code.
I can also do regular backend work, database design, make basic native desktop applications. I'm capable of getting into complex codebases and maintaining them.
I'm also long term interested in reverse engineering practicies, sometimes these allow you to do things no one else ever did.

Due to huge variety of finished projects, I learned to stop obsessing over tools and best practices,
focusing on finishing the job and getting desired results instead, while making solutions easy to maintain only when it makes sense to.

I always look for some value for myself or other people in every project approached, be it solving a problem or a learning opportunity.

Occasionally, I help people with programming in Discord server: [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/BQN6BYE).

Aside from programming and development, I'm also interested in video game design. I enjoy travelling, motorsports, and birds.
