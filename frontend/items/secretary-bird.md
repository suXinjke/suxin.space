Originally created to moderate and ban for disgusting chat messages,
**Secretary bird** was then transferred to a certain **Discord community** I'm no
longer a part of.

This bird bot used to answer the dumbest questions, announced
**Twitch streams** and was also available to use **Twitter**.

By interacting with the bot we've found out that it's rather angry
and loves **pepsi** and **kit-kat** alot.

On **MAY 12th 2020** bot was shutdown due to it's services no longer being required
and hosting expenses not worth it.

Nothing impressive, but it always got the job done, [source code here](https://github.com/suXinjke/SecretaryBird).
