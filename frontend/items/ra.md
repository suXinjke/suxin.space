RetroAchievements is a community focused on developing and earning achievements for various emulated consoles, like Sega Genesis, NES, Playstation and many others.

I took note of this in the middle of 2021, first by replaying [Gran Turismo](https://retroachievements.org/game/11320), then making my first set for [Colony Wars: Vengeance](https://retroachievements.org/game/11562). Since then I became part of the community: making new sets, or [improving existing ones](https://retroachievements.org/game/11391).

My best work includes achievement sets for [Gran Turismo 4](https://retroachievements.org/game/20580) and [Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec](https://retroachievements.org/game/2830) for Playstation 2, both of which required reverse engineering efforts and also made me create my first JavaScript library - [cruncheevos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cruncheevos/core), to assist in maintaining the sets. I'm most proud of set for [Ace Combat 3](https://retroachievements.org/game/11308), which I consider the most creative all around.

You can read details on what the [initial work](/notes/retroachievements-development-experience/) felt like. I also wrote a big blogpost on [debugging and reverse engineering](/notes/tracking-down-playstation-pointers-using-debuggers-ghidra/) specifically for RetroAchievements community.
